Android TV App powered by [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

It is a easy way to find the best TV content, the top movies, series... all of that in your TV.

The goal of the project is to be a guide line about Android TV, that shows how to use the Leanback library from Google. The project also uses the popular libraries and tools from the Android ecosystem. 

The main widgets from Android TV are used: `BrowseSupportFragment`, `SearchSupportFragment`, `DetailsSupportFragment`, `VerticalSupportFragment`.

## API Documentation
BESTV uses [the version 3 of The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). You can find all the documentation about the requests and the responses responses there.

## API Keys
BESTV uses [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API in order to fetch all the data, but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.
To be able to run this application you have to create an API KEY from The Movie DB and place it in your gradle file.
<br>
```
buildConfigField "String", "TMDB_API_KEY", "YOUR API KEY HERE"
```

## Features
<ul>
<li>Show the top movies and tv shows</li>
<li>Show the top movies and tv shows by genre</li>
<li>Details about a work including the casts, the videos, the similar and recommended works</li>
<li>Details about a cast including the credits</li>
<li>Search the movies and the tv shows by title</li>
</ul>

## Modules
The app is modularized. We can see the dependency graph with all the modules.
